# AdGuard AI
## Instant Ad Compliance Checker: An AI-Powered Multimodal Tool for Fast, Policy-Safe Ad Approvals

![AdGuard AI Overview](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/abe02418-85fc-4c63-9612-1080aa0f17f7)

### üöÄ Overview

Digital advertising platforms face a major challenge in ensuring that ads comply with strict policy guidelines. Advertisers often submit creatives (text, images, videos, landing pages) that unintentionally violate rules, leading to delayed approvals, repeated rejections, and wasted time for both advertisers and internal review teams. Manual compliance checks are resource-intensive and slow, creating friction in the ad publishing pipeline.

Our product, the **Instant Ad Compliance Checker**, solves this problem by providing advertisers with an AI-powered tool that pre-screens ad content before submission. By detecting potential violations early, advertisers can make corrections instantly, reducing back-and-forth cycles and accelerating the approval process.

## ‚ú® Key Features

The tool's value lies in its **multimodal AI approach**:

- **üìù Text/Ad Copy Analysis**: Fine-tuned LLMs flag prohibited language, exaggerated claims, and formatting violations using RAG-based policy compliance
- **üñºÔ∏è Image Analysis**: Qwen2.5 7B parameter model detects adult/violent imagery, trademark misuse, or misleading visual cues
- **üé• Video Analysis**: Adaptive frame sampling with frames passed to image model for inappropriate visuals detection
- **üåê Landing Page Checks**: Browser Use Agent crawls and validates that page content aligns with ad promises
- **üéôÔ∏è Voice Analysis**: Whisper integration for audio transcription and policy violation detection
- **ü§ñ Interactive Clarification**: AI-assisted calls with transcript analysis and compliance score updates

## üéØ Unique Selling Point (USP)

What makes this product stand out is its **explainable AI-driven reporting**. Instead of just rejecting ads, it provides clear, actionable feedback with compliance scores, severity levels, and improvement suggestions. This transforms compliance from a bottleneck into a collaborative, AI-assisted process empowering advertisers and streamlining review operations.

## üß† AI/LLM Architecture

![AI Use Case Architecture](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/17223e23-ad47-4b20-8aee-8bddd0abcb2f)

### Central Role of AI/LLMs:
- AI and LLMs are the core engines driving compliance checks across all ad modalities (text, image, video, landing page)
- They perform contextual reasoning, identify prohibited content, detect misleading claims, and generate explainable compliance reports

### Models & Techniques Leveraged:

1. **Text Analysis**: 
   - **Qwen2.5 7B parameter model** for detecting prohibited or misleading ad copy and claims
   - RAG-based policy text model for contextual compliance checking

2. **Image Analysis**: 
   - **Qwen2.5 7B parameter model** for scene understanding and policy violation detection
   - YOLO for banned object detection
   - PaddleOCR for text overlay extraction

3. **Video Analysis**:
   - **Adaptive frame sampling** technique for efficient processing
   - Frames passed to **Qwen2.5 7B parameter model** for scene understanding
   - YOLO for object detection in frames
   - **Whisper** for audio transcription
   - PaddleOCR for text overlays
   - Multi-modal fusion with Policy LLM for holistic compliance reasoning

4. **Landing Page Analysis**: 
   - **Browser Use Agent** for automated page visiting and content extraction
   - RAG system + LLM to match ad claims with page content

5. **Voice Processing**:
   - **Whisper** integration for accurate speech-to-text conversion
   - Policy compliance checking on transcribed audio content

6. **Policy RAG System**: 
   - Retrieves relevant policy documents for LLM-guided reasoning
   - Context-aware policy violation detection
