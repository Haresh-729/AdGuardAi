### üöÄ Overview

Digital advertising platforms face a major challenge in ensuring that ads comply with strict policy guidelines. Advertisers often submit creatives (text, images, videos, landing pages) that unintentionally violate rules, leading to delayed approvals, repeated rejections, and wasted time for both advertisers and internal review teams. Manual compliance checks are resource-intensive and slow, creating friction in the ad publishing pipeline.

Our product, the **Instant Ad Compliance Checker**, solves this problem by providing advertisers with an AI-powered tool that pre-screens ad content before submission. By detecting potential violations early, advertisers can make corrections instantly, reducing back-and-forth cycles and accelerating the approval process.
